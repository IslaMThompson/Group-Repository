# Code of Conduct

As members of this project team, we commit to:

- Communicating respectfully and clearly with each other.  
- Valuing each memberâ€™s contributions and perspectives.  
- Resolving disagreements through open discussion.  
- Asking for help when needed and offering support when possible.  
- Using GitHub Issues and group chats for project communication.  

If conflicts cannot be resolved within the group, we will involve our project supervisor.  

This Code of Conduct helps us work effectively together and create a positive, collaborative environment.
