## ðŸš€ Project Setup & Workflow

This repository represents our **teamâ€™s foundation** for the coursework project.  
For **Code Review 1**, our focus was not on delivering features, but on ensuring a **robust development workflow** that supports the rest of the project.

We chose the following stack and practices:

| Tool/Method      | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **IntelliJ IDEA** | Main development environment |
| **Maven**        | Dependency management & JAR packaging |
| **Docker**       | Containerisation & reproducibility |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline (build + Docker test) |
| **GitFlow**      | Branching strategy (`master`, `develop`, `release`) |

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Deployment

### Maven Build in IntelliJ IDEA
- The project is built using **Maven** (`mvn clean install`)
- Produces a **self-contained JAR** in `/target`

### Dockerised Application
- A **Dockerfile** builds and runs the JAR inside a container
- Validated both locally and on **GitHub Actions**

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Every push triggers **GitHub Actions**
- Workflow runs:
    1. Maven build â†’ JAR
    2. Docker build â†’ container
    3. Run container tests

---

## ðŸ”€ GitFlow in Action

We follow **GitFlow branching strategy**:
master â†’ production-ready code
develop â†’ integration of new features
release â†’ snapshot for tagged releases


âœ” First release created from `release` branch.

## ðŸ“Š Backlog & Documentation

- **Product Backlog**: Maintained in `/docs` and GitHub Projects
- **Code of Conduct**: Defined in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- **Meeting Notes**: Logged in `/docs/reviews/`

## ðŸ“ˆ What We Learned (So Far)

- Setting up a project in **IntelliJ with Maven + Docker** is more complex than expected, but now fully automated.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** ensures our builds are repeatable and transparent for all team members.
- **GitFlow** keeps development organised â€” feature branches merge into `develop`, which then feeds into `release` before final approval to `master`.
- Working with **Docker** early gives us confidence that deployment wonâ€™t be a last-minute problem.
